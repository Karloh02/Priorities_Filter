This project is capaable of doing many things. 

In the company that i am working we are now migrating for the new system SAP 4HANA and we need to gather some information from the old SAP and add new information to the program. 

This code does the following: 

It opens an Excel file that contain all the data that we need to download from SAP; 
It saves this information for later, removing all the duplicated data; 
Than it creates a new excel file with some VBA code in it;
Than it runs the VBA code, and dowload all the data we need from SAP;

#I don't jnow if this is the faster way to download data; but this was the solution i found; i didn't find any other python API that could do the SAP dowload, so i went with the escel sollution. 

And finaly the program reads all the data and save some important infomration about the data; for my case, it read a dxf file and give me the perimeter; and the area by some simple mathmatics. 

In case of any doubts regarding the code; please feel free to reach me out; or if you have any comments/sugestions about it; I will really enjoy reading it. 

If you read it util here; thanks very much, I am starting in this coding World, hope this code can be somehow useful for someone. 
Love from Brazil!
